# Social-Event-App
An iOS app to share an sign up for social events using the Aggregator Business Model. Basically Uber/Lyft but for social events. 
This was built during my CS V class in Lakeside School with classmates Brandon Zhang and Gaurav Sharma. The core code we wrote (in Swift)
is located at Social-Event-App\project-3 2\Test\Test. This app also uses a firebase database to store new and previous events
however I cannot garuntee the database is still formatted correctly and active therefore some parts of the app may not function as intended. Similarly it required a ChronJob running on my school's server to delete expired events; however, that may also not be running
which could also result in unintended functionality.
